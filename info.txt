Super Metroid - Meteor Ball Revamped Version 1.1
==================================================
Original meteor ball hack author is unknown
Revamped version made by Kaepora Gaebora

Meteor ball was an ability that was used in Super Metroid Ancient Chozo.
Bomb jumps give Samus speed booster properties, and diagonal bomb jumps also propel Samus really far.
The mod author of the original meteor ball hack is unknown. 
I decided to reverse engineer the code and port meteor ball to the vanilla game and reprogram it with some changes.

This revamped version comes with the following changes:
	- Now propells Samus faster and further
	- Speed echoes visual effect is now applied
	- Can be triggered while Samus is in any pose
	- Can be chained into via infinite bomb jumping
	- Can now also be done with power bombs
	
Ver 1.1:
	- Fixed the quicksand softlock. Meteor ball state is disabled when landing in quicksand.
	
Ver 1.0:
	- Initial meteor ball revamped release.
