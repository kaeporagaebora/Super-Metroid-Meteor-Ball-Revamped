# Super-Metroid-Meteor-Ball-Revamped

A revamped version of the meteor ball ability that was used in Super Metroid Ancient Chozo, now playable in the vanilla game.

Mod author of the original is unknown, but I wanted it to be playable in the vanilla game, and have also made the following modifications:

### Changes
- Now propells Samus faster and further

- Speed echoes effect is now applied

- Can be triggered while Samus is in any pose

- Can be chained into via infinite bomb jumping

- Can now also be done with power bombs
	
### NOTE: 
Be careful when using meteor ball in the colloseum room, as it is sometimes possible to get softlocked when landing in a particular part of the quicksand.

Aside from that there should be no issues.
